for fusion set all the following to "True":
    "SegmentationHead": "True",
    "radar_input": "True",
    "camera_input": "True",
    "fusion": "True"

for camera only set the following appropriately:
    "SegmentationHead": "True",
    "radar_input": "False",
    "camera_input": "True",
    "fusion": "False"

There are 8 architectures namely:
    "only_camera": "True",
    "early_fusion": "False",
    "x0_fusion": "False",
    "x1_fusion": "False",
    "x2_fusion": "False",
    "x3_fusion": "False",
    "x4_fusion": "False",
    "after_decoder_fusion": "False"

Only one of the above shall be set to "True" based on which model you want to train.

You may also try with a different random "seed".
